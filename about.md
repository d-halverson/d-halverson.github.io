Hello, my name is Drew Halverson, and I am a Senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison studying computer science. As I am writing this (8/14/21), I am finishing up my internship with Amazon as a Software Developer. This has been an amazing experience and time to grow my communication, critical thinking, and technical skills! I had the chance to work with various AWS technologies such as Lambda, DynamoDB, SQS, AppConfig, and IAM while working on my assigned project that tracks versions of continuously deployed datasets so that the proper versions can be served to the clients.

Previously, I also spent time working as a Software Engineer Team Lead with a start up called the [Trulight Project](https://trulightproject.com). During my time working with this project, I worked with a small team of other interns to complete tasks such as: researching and selecting a cloud computing platform, designing UML to clearly communicate code structure, creating a backend algorithm that lives on Google Cloud Platform, and developing an API on GCP with Spring framework and OpenAPI. This opportunity was a great first experience with a formal team in the industry.

I also enjoy working on some of my own personal coding projects, such as my [File Backup Tools](https://github.com/d-halverson/File-Backup-Tools) project. You can read more about these projects in the [blog](https://d-halverson.github.io/blog/) section of this website, or visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/d-halverson) to get a closer look.
