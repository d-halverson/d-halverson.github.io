<p>Hi! I am Drew Halverson, I am a sophomore at UW-Madison studying computer science. I have found some great groups of people to get involved with on campus here, such as Kappa Eta Kappa, the professional engineering co-ed fraternity that I am a member of, and Chi Alpha, a christian campus ministry organization. I love solving problems with creative solutions, and I have found that computers are the perfect medium for me to do this with. Outside of class and clubs, I enjoy practicing coding related problems and studying computer science topics, because I am always curious and want to learn more. Currently I am working on a program that analyzes backup hard drives with the usage of a tree data structure in Java and detects files that the user no longer needs. Last year I attended the University of St. Thomas for my first year of college, and found that it was not the right fit for me, as it was much too small and did not have nearly as many opportunities and experiences available as there are here in Madison. Last summer I spent my time working at Elite Sports Clubs as a summer camp counselor, where I grew my interpersonal skills significantly. Not only did I spend most of my day working with kids ranging from age four to thirteen, but I also was tasked with ensuring the parents of these children that they are in a safe and fun environment during their time with us. Within the next few years, I hope to spend time as an intern in positions related to software development, my true passion.</p>
