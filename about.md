Hi! I am Drew Halverson, I am a Junior at UW-Madison studying computer science. I am currently spending my free time working as an unpaid software engineer intern with a start up called the [Trulight Project](https://trulightproject.com). During my time working on this project so far, I have worked with a small team of other interns to complete tasks such as: researching and selecting a cloud computing platform, designing UML to clearly communicate code structure, creating a backend algorithm that lives on Google Cloud Platform, and creating an API with on GCP with Spring framework and OpenAPI. This opportunity has been a great experience so far to learn and see first hand how a formal team works together and get assignments done.

I also enjoy working on some of my own personal coding projects, such as my [File Backup Tools](https://github.com/d-halverson/File-Backup-Tools) project. You can read more about these projects in the [blog](https://d-halverson.github.io/blog/) section of this website, or visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/d-halverson) to get a closer look.
